# DocuRift

DocuRift is a powerful tool that automatically generates and maintains REST API documentation by observing real API traffic. It acts as a proxy between your clients and API server, capturing and analyzing requests and responses to create comprehensive documentation.

This is particular useful for existing REST API service with live traffic but lack of documentation. Setup DocuRift as a proxy to run in front of your existing service and wait for a period of time, and come back to get your Open API spec and Postman Collection! 

This is safe to run in production environment as it does not send any data out, and masks sensitive user information by default. Analyzer and document generator runs asynchronously without additional performance penalty to your existing service!

## Quick Start

1. Start DocuRift with your desired configuration:
```bash
./bin/docurift -proxy-port 9876 -analyzer-port 9877 -backend-url http://localhost:8080 -max-examples 20
```
Note: backend url should be where your backend is running.

2. Start your API server (example using the included shop API) on port 8080 and send test traffic:
```bash
cd examples/shop
lsof -ti :8080 | xargs kill
go run shop.go &
sleep 3
go test -count=1 .
```
