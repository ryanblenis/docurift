# DocuRift

DocuRift is a powerful tool that automatically generates and maintains REST API documentation by observing real API traffic. It acts as a proxy between your clients and API server, capturing and analyzing requests and responses to create comprehensive documentation.

This is particular useful for existing REST API service with live traffic but lack of documentation. Setup DocuRift as a proxy to run in front of your existing service and wait for a period of time, and come back to get your Open API spec and Postman Collection! 

This is safe to run in production environment as it does not send any data out, and masks sensitive user information by default. Analyzer and document generator runs asynchronously without additional performance penalty to your existing service!
